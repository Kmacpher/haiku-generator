Notes from Manuscript:

First paragraph - I'm not quite sure, but I think that 'appears' needs a helper verb, like 'appears to'.

On page 6, gamma is not rendering properly. Just make sure that the pdf you send has the greek letters! 

At the bottom of page 6, do you need to specify that the gene expression profiles were microarrays, or does that not matter?

At the bottom of page 9, we say that "Upon high-fat feeding, the absolute levels and frequency of these cells increases in both depots, albeit levels remain lower than in males." However, the levels of Zfp423 in the female inguinal is not necessarily lower than the levels in male inguinal. I'd say that it's higher or that there is no dependable difference. 

Bottom of page 10, the '-' between DOX and containing (doxycycline (DOX)-containing food results) is just awkward.

Supplementary data:

After second title (BAC Recombineering) has a weird box after it. However, I am using Google docs, so disregard if it's not in your copy or the PDF

In the cover letter, don't forget to replace 'Page X' found on page 7!
